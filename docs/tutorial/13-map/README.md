If you have read the documentation page of the thermometer node, you will have
noticed that it provides an output temperature value to the `Tc` pin in degrees
Celsius. If we’re going to show the temperature with an arrow driven by a servo,
we’re in trouble. The `servo` node can work only with values ranging from 0 to
1 (0 is 0°, 1 is 180°).

The practical task is to make the servo rotate smoothly from 0 to 90°,
reflecting a temperature change from 20°C to 50°C.

You can actually do this using few math nodes, but XOD has a special node for
such cases. This node is called the `map-range` node.

The node has pins:

* `X` — the input value that needs to be transformed;
* `Smin` — the lower bound of the input range;
* `Smax` — the upper bound of the input range;
* `Tmin` — the lower bound of the transformed value;
* `Tmax` — the upper bound of the transformed value;
* `Xm` — the mapped (transformed) value.

Setting them properly would map an input from one range to an output in another.

## Test circuit

## How-to

1. Add the `xod/core/map-range` node to your patch.
2. Link the `X` input to a value to be mapped.
3. Set input (source) range bounds with `Smin` and `Smax` (e.g. 20 and 50).
4. Set output (target) range bounds with `Tmin` and `Tmax` (e.g. 0 and 0.5).
5. Use `Xm` as the resulting value in the new range.

If you followed the example try to heat the thermometer with a hot object (i.e.
a paper knife heated with a lighfire). At a temperature of 35°C (half the input
range), the servo should rotate to 45°, which is half the output range.
