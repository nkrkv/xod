In the node list (below the `welcome-to-xod`), you will find `xod/common-hardware` section. This is a *library* where you can find nodes to work with specific hardware.\n\n3. Find the `led` node. Note that nodes are arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n4. Hover the cursor over that node and click the plus (+) symbol to add it to the patch.\n\n5. Drag this node to any slot. \n\n6. Now, assign the new values for the `PORT` and `LUM` pins to turn on the second LED.\n\n7. Upload the patch to the Arduino.\n\nBoth LEDs should turn on now.\n\nAlternatively, you may drag a node from the Project Browser instead of clicking\nthe (+) button. Try to add yet more `led` nodes to your project.",
