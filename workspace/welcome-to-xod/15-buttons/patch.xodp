      "content": "So, buttons!\n\nWe have already added the `button` node from `xod/common-hardware`. The `button` node has a purple output pin called the `PRS`. This pin returns a new type of data: *boolean*.\n\nBoolean data can have either of two values: true or false. In our case, the `button` node returns a value of `false` when idle and `true` while the button is being pressed.\n\nGood news, in XOD boolean and number data types are compatible. Here are two rules of datacasting:\n\n* Boolean-to-number: if you send a boolean false to a numeric (green) input, it will be interpreted as a numeric 0; if you send a boolean true, it will be interpreted as a numeric 1.\n* Number-to-boolean: if you send any numeric value except 0 to a boolean (purple) input; it will be interpreted as true, and if you send 0, it will be interpreted as false.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Assemble a circuit as on https://goo.gl/euz896\n\n2. Set the `PORT` value.\n\n3. Link the `PRS` pin to the `LUM` pin.\n\n4. Upload your patch.\n\nWhen you press the button the `button` node sets the `PRS` pin to `true`, the `led` node (`LUM` pin) interprets it as 1, and the LED turns on at full brightness.",
